# Machine Learning Code Visualization Tool

## Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive tool for visualizing machine learning code, with a focus on creating both static and dynamic visualizations of matrix operations as they are executed in real-time. The goal is to provide an intuitive and educational way to see how machine learning algorithms, particularly those implemented in PyTorch, manipulate data through various matrix operations.


## Goals

- **Static Visualization**: Create detailed static visualizations that accurately represent the state of matrix operations at any given point in a machine learning algorithm.
- **Real-Time Renderer**: Develop a real-time rendering system that allows users to see visualizations of matrix operations as the code executes.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Implement a system that provides step-by-step visualizations through the machine learning code, helping users and learners to follow the flow and transformation of data.
